# Calculator-Program
Write a program to evaluate simple calculations:  +  -  *  /  

You will enter a simple equations (keyboard) and print out the equation followed by an = sign and the answer to the equation.  For +  -  *  will be simple integer answers, for / print quotient and remainder.  Print answers to a file.
 Use the following input to test your program:  ( I like the blanks before and after operators.)

	56 + 283
	281 - 275
	250 / 23
	6993 * 4
	99999 + 1111
	99990  /  333
	2550 * 150
	123456 - 12345

Sample output:    56 + 283  =  339
